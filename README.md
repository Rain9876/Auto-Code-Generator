# GAP-Gen: Guided Automatic Python Code Generation
This is the repositiory for the paper GAP-GEN: Guided Automatic Python Code Generation published on EACL-SRW 2023.

Our project is based one python3.7+ versions. 
1. For running the fine-tuning code, please directly run the > main.py file. 
2. The data processing methods are defined in the data_processing folder.
3. For evaluating the model performance, please run the evaluate.py file.
4. The dataset can be downloaded using the method defined in dataset folder.
